- 👋 Hi, I’m @Galuito
- 📖 I have a lot of knowledge over basic python and it's syntax.
- 📝 I take good notes of everything I do and keep everything documented if I were to need it someday.
- 🧠 I love taking on thinking and logic problems, they normally end up being beaten by me.
- 📫 How to reach me ---> nluisgalue20@gmail.com
